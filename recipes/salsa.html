        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Restaurant-Style Salsa — This easy salsa recipe is a blessing and a curse. Because chips and salsa. The more you have, the more you want. But lucky you, this salsa recipe will teach you how to make salsa at home in just a few minutes in the blender, so you’ll never run out!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>one 28-ounce can tomatoes, including juice   (I used these whole, peeled plum tomatoes)</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 or 2 jalepeno peppers, de-stemmed and roughly chopped*</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, or to taste(remember some brands of tomatoes and chips are much saltier than others)</li>
            <li>1/4 to 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, optional and to taste**</li>
            <li>1 or 2 handfuls cilantro leaves, discard stems (I prefer 2)</li>
            <li>about 3 tablespoons lime juice</li>
            <li>about 3/4 cup corn, optional</li>
            <li>about 3/4 cup canned black beans, drained and rinsed, optional</li>
            <li>corn chips, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Add all ingredients (except optional corn and beans) to the canister of a blender or food processor in the order listed. Pulse or blend on high power until texture is as smooth as desired. If you have a very strong blender, you probably don’t need to pre-chop the ingredients before adding them to the blender, but I do just to make sure I don’t get large random, accidentally unblended chunks of any one ingredient.</li>
            <li>Taste the salsa and based on personal preference tweak as necessary.</li>
            <li>Optionally stir in the corn and black beans</li>
            <li>Transfer to airtight container and serve immediately with chips. However, I prefer to refrigerate salsa for 1 day prior to serving because I prefer chilled salsa and because the flavors marry, mellow, and the flavor improves on the second and third day. Salsa will likely keep up to 1 week airtight in the fridge; however, we’ve always eaten a batch within 3 days.</li>
        </ol>
